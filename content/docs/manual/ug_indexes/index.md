## Rebuild Index

After making an update on your remote reference there may be unbuilt changes on your index. To rebuild your index after the update click the **Indexes** tab on the detailed view page of your official reference.

Then click the blue **Rebuild the index** link. 

A **Rebuild Index** dialog box will appear that will list all the changes that are going to be made.
