# Concepts {#users}

## Ownership

When users create new entities (_eg_. samples, references, jobs), their identities are automatically assigned

Users can own or at least have their identities tied to many other types of data in Virtool. These include:

samples

## Rights

Rights are properties of samples and references that control what actions specific users or user groups are allowed to perform.

## Groups

Groups

## Permissions

Permissions are used to control what application-level actions users are allowed to perform. Permissions are inherited through group membership.

Administrators automatically pass all permission checks.
